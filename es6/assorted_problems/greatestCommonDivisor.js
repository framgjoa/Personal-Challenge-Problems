//In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers,
//when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that
//divides the numbers without a remainder.
//For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4. Any two prime numbers will have a GCD of 1.

let gcd = (number1, number2) => {
  
};

//EXTRA CREDIT: Solve with recursion

let gcd_recursive = (number1, number2) => {

};
