# Personal-Challenge-Problems

In this repo I will be using ES6 to work through interview style coding challenges.

#ES6 Resources:
* [Slides covering some basic new features of ES6](http://slides.com/tneufeld/ecmascript-2015#/)


# Getting Started Babel and ES6

* `npm install`

* `bower install`

* to watch for changes and to automatically re-transpile your files use :

  * `grunt watch`

#Solving Problems

* Each problem module is located in the es6 folder

* From there select the module and problem you would like to work on

#Contributing to this Repo

* Styles must match airbnb's style guide. https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#arrow-functions
